# Mastermind Clojure Pairing Group at The Recurse Center

This is an attempt to implement the [Mastermind code breaking game][mastermind]
via pair programming in Clojure with friends at [Recurse Center][recurse].

For pair programming, we're using:

- tmate (hi-res terminal sharing)
- Zoom (audio/video)
- vim with fireplace for quasi-repl and file eval
- `lein repl` for nrepl server
- `tail -f .lein-repl-history` for copy/pasting the history
- tmux for split pane

Since this is part of a book club, we're using concepts from "The Joy of
Clojure" (Manning Press) and "The Elements of Clojure" in writing our code.

Ironically, though we are implementing Mastermind, the board game, these
pairing sessions also serve as ["mastermind group"][group] for a few
professional programmers expanding their functional programming horizons beyond
the usual concepts found in languages like Python and JavaScript.
